## Social Chatting Application

Welcome to the Social Chatting Application! This platform allows users to connect with friends, chat individually or in groups, and participate in active lobbies based on shared interests. Users can add friends, send friend requests, and create or join lobbies where they can queue up with up to 5 friends. The unique feature of this application is the groupchat matchmaking system, where users can find and join lobbies with friends, and be matched and engage with another lobby based on similar hobbies and interests via groupchats.

- **Active Lobbies**: Users can create active lobbies and invite up to 5 friends to join. They can select a category for the lobby, such as movies, food, shows, sports, music, anime, etc.
